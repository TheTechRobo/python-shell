# python-shell
Simple, commented Python shell. Doesn't seem to work with the Python Launcher, but works with IDLE and normal Python (no Python Launcher). Functions just like a terminal, but different commands

Thanks for using! Your support inspires me  :heart:

# How to use CustPy
There are many commands to use! Here's a... 
### Tutorial
#### How to use commands
Launch the program. It should say, 
##### Last Login: Unknown. !
Type your command after the !. Here, we'll type win. It should say, 
##### This ain't MS-DOS
Type ls for a list of commands. Have fun!  
#### How to use the comments
If you go into the _shell.py, it's complex. So, that's why I added comments. Any words after a hashtag, e.g.
#this is a comment
##### EXAMPLE
Look at the following:  
print("This ain't MS-DOS") #output This ain't MS-DOS
In that case, #output This ain't MS-DOS would be the comment, but print("This ain't MS-DOS") is a Python command. 
#### I hope you LOVE CustPy... if you have any feed-back WHATSOEVER please leave it in the Issues section




# PLEASE NOTE! 
### CustPy IS dependent on python 3 or later, 2.x might work, but I doubt it
### Also, early versions of Python 3.x may not work. I have tested on a) Python 3.6.5 — in IDLE, and b) in Python 3.7.3 — in cmd
