# BEFORE CONTRIBUTING, PLEASE.......

(i) Click the Projects tab above, check out both. See if you can help with any one of those to-dos.
(ii) If you are fixing a bug, go to the Projects tab, click Bugs, bugs, bugs and click + above the tab that is relevant and add detail; if you are adding a feature do the same but in the other Project. Do note that you **can** move notes if you just finished.
(iii) Make sure that you are **improving** something, not just adding your name
(iv) Test thoroughly to make sure the new feature—or bugfix—works. This may seem obvious but— too many people forget

Thank you for taking the time to improve CustPy. I really do appreciate it :)
