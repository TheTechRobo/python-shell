# BEFORE CONTRIBUTING, PLEASE.......

(i) click the Projects tab above, check out both. See if you can help with any one of these
(ii) If you are fixing a bug, go to the Projects tab, click Bugs, bugs, bugs and click + above the tab that is relevant
(iii) Make sure that you are **improving** something, not just adding your name
(iv) Test thoroughly to make sure the new feature—or bugfix—works. This may seem obvious but— too many people forget

Thank you for the time improving CustPy. I really do appreciate it :)
